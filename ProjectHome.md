compearth ("computational earth") contains two projects: surfacevel2strain and moment tensor.

surfacevel2strain uses spherical wavelets to estimate scalar and vector fields on the surface of a sphere. The practical applications include (1) constructing a smooth topographic surface from discrete scalar observations (for example, a Moho map from a set of receiver functions); (2) constructing a smooth strain-rate map from a set of discrete GPS vector observations on the Earth's surface.

momenttensor contains some scripts (Matlab, Mathematica, GMT) for plotting and interpreting full moment tensors on the fundamental lune. Reference: W. Tape and C.
